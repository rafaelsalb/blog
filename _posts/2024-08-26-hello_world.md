So, what is this blog?

I will talk about my intentions and include something interesting in this page, because a bunch of text talking about me and only that would be quite lame.

In short, a creative outlet for its writer. On that, who am I? I'm Rafael Albuquerque, a 3rd year Computer Science student who enjoys the deep, complicated parts about programming, mathematics and computers, and wishes to do much more than what is humanly feasible. My mind is a bit too energetic when compared to my body, so it needs an exhaust. Well, I get this is it!

I might talk about programming, mathematics, computers, physics, a bit of philosophy and maybe some other stuff my mind choses to fixate in. I don't know.

Let's see how it goes. Now, to fulfill my promise...
